    <section id="roadmap">
<h2>Planned Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Benchmark/GPU Database Expansion:</strong> Support for more and mixed workloads. Currently supports GROMACS and AMBER with data export (CSV/JSON), plus custom data uploads (CSV/JSON) for users. </li>
  
  <li><strong>Preset Profiles:</strong> Top 10 clusters from the Top500 or Green500 list, etc. Currently, Alex (A40, A100) is a clear candidate, since benchmark data is already available.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Improved Visualisation, in priority order</strong>
    <ul>      
      <li><strong>Heatmap:</strong> GPU × Benchmark performance and power visualization. Currently only available for sensitivity analysis.</li>
      
      <li><strong>TCO Breakdown Pie Chart:</strong> Add a chart format toggle (stack vs. pie). Currently only a stacked chart is available.</li>

      <li><strong>Multi-Year TCO Projection with Depreciation Curves:</strong> Visualize how total cost accumulates over the system’s lifetime. GPU cluster loses value over time affects Accounting, TCO realism and ROI and resale value (X-axis: 0 to lifetime in years; Y-axis: Cumulative TCO as a line and Depreciated asset value as shaded area). comment: Not sure how to factor this in, but in a commercial setting, asset value or cost decline over time matters. Since hardware loses value over time but power costs stay constant, power might be more important than hardware cost over the cluster's lifetime. </li>
      
      <li><strong>Monte Carlo / Uncertainty Analysis:</strong> Select parameters with a ± range, run 1000+ randomized calculations. Display mean, standard deviation, and box or violin plots of performance/TCO results. For example, one can tweak parameters like W prefactors in the power model or the node's baseline power to see how they affect performance per TCO.</li>

  	  <li><strong>Price change history chart:</strong> Prices are sourced from deltacomputer.com when available; otherwise from alternate.de, sysgen.de, or internal records. VAT was added if missing. One can always adjust the pricing if needed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
    <li><strong>Low-impact features (fun add-ons):</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Configuration Recommendation Engine:</strong> Suggest actionable ways to improve performance/TCO based on current inputs (trained on user sessions or simulated configs). Currently only provides a basic rule-based Smart Strategy Tip.</li>

  <li><strong>Detailed PDF Report Generator:</strong> Export project reports with charts and explanations and add a report format toggle (Summary vs. Detailed). Currently offers only a simple PDF report generator.</li>
    
  <li><strong>Collaboration Mode:</strong> Share calculation setups with teammates via unique, bookmarkable, shareable public URLs with embedded settings. Currently includes a simple auto-generated blog summary share option.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Programmatic Access:</strong> API access to the benchmark and calculation engine for researchers and developers. Currently limited to a private GitHub repository.</li>
      
  <li><strong>Currency Selector:</strong> Support for USD, GBP, INR, and more. Currently only supports EUR.</li>

  <li><strong>SEO Optimization:</strong> Add meta tags, sitemap.xml, alt text.</li>
</ul>
</ul>



        <h2> Model Assessment of Current Extensions; 🚦Overengineered?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong> ✅ Frequency Factor</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> W_node_baseline(f_cCPU, f_ucCPU) = W_baseCPU + W_dynamicCPU + W_noncompute</li>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> W_gpu(f_GPU)</li>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> f_cCPU, f_ucCPU and f_GPU represents core CPU frequency, uncore CPU frequency and GPU frequency. Example: On Alex, power usage is split as 11.6% CPU, 55% GPU, and 33.4% non-compute (including 6% fan and 27.4% other components) </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>❓ Cooling Types & PUE Modeling</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> PUE = (factor_air * PUE_Air + factor_water * PUE_Water) / 2</li>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> Incorporates cooling types (air-cooled, water-cooled), weighting factors for the fraction of energy consumption between air-cooled and water-cooled cluster to model heterogeneous clusters. Another variation: different codes on CPU and GPU clusters with varying PUEs require a weighted sum of benchmark power use.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>❓ Maintenance Cost Split: Capital vs. Operational</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> Capital cost applies to the first 3 years (as per DFG rules), while operational cost covers the remaining lifetime.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>❓ Hardware vs. Software Maintenance Split</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>❓ Software Cost Dependency on Node Count</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> Many commercial licenses scale with node count, such as Moya scheduler, SUSE Enterprise, or IBM file systems like GPFS.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>❓ Data Center Temperature as a Factor</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> Temperature is a side effect of cooling infrastructure; efforts to reduce it (e.g., via chilled air or cooling systems) must be factored into the TCO.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>❓ CO2 Emission Factor</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> Assumes 100% green electricity usage at FAU.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>❓ Net Present Value (NPV) Factor</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> NPV compares the value of future cash flows to the initial investment. Clearly define cash flow periods in the model.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>⚠️ Conflict: Billed per hour vs. per kWh</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> A high-efficiency application may consume more power but finish faster—lowering runtime costs while increasing energy bills. Flag in documentation or include as a toggle option.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
