      <p>Here's a preview of the upcoming features I'm working on to make PerfPerTCO even more powerful and user-friendly:</p>
    </section>

    <section id="roadmap">
<h2>Planned Features</h2>
<ul>

  <li><strong>Benchmark/GPU Database Expansion:</strong> Support for more and mixed workloads from different domains (ML, CFD, molecular dynamics), e.g., AI (TensorFlow, MLPerf) and HPC loads (OpenFOAM, LAMMPS),  Currently supports GROMACS and AMBER with data export (CSV/JSON), plus custom data uploads (CSV/JSON) for users. </li>

  <li><strong>Heterogeneous cluster of N different architectures</strong> For example, Helma cluster has three parts: Helma 1, Helma 2 and CPU</li>

  <li>Rather than assuming GPUs operate constantly, simulate a job mix (some jobs heavy, some light) or utilization curves. Compute effective utilization (e.g. 70% usage, peaks, idle periods) more realistically.</li>

  <li>Allow exploring how undervolting/underclocking or thermal throttling affects performance, power, TCO.</ul>

  <li>Given a budget, power budget, or emission cap, automatically suggest optimal GPU combinations/cluster sizes to maximize target metrics (perf/TCO, perf/emissions, etc.).</ul>

  <li><strong>Improved Visualisation, in priority order</strong>
    <ul>      
      <li><strong>Fixed energy approach than a fixed budget</strong> Particularly relevant for larger insulations having power plants (LANL) and to a lesser extent for FAU power supplies at NHR@FAU. For example, given an X MW infrastructure, a cluster exceeding X MW within the allowed budget won’t work. How far can you optimize power (by reducing power cap or adjusting CPU/GPU clocks) before it forces you to switch to a different GPU? Given a power limit, how large can the system be while staying within the allowed budget?</li>

      <li><strong>Multi-Year TCO Projection with Depreciation Curves:</strong> Visualize how total cost accumulates over the system’s lifetime. GPU cluster loses value over time affects Accounting, TCO realism and ROI and resale value (X-axis: 0 to lifetime in years; Y-axis: Cumulative TCO as a line and Depreciated asset value as shaded area). comment: Not sure how to factor this in, but in a commercial setting, asset value or cost decline over time matters. Since hardware loses value over time but power costs stay constant, power might be more important than hardware cost over the cluster's lifetime. </li>
      
      <li><strong>Monte Carlo / Uncertainty Analysis:</strong> Select parameters with a ± range, run 1000+ randomized calculations. Display mean, standard deviation, and box or violin plots of performance/TCO results. For example, one can tweak parameters like W prefactors in the power model or the node's baseline power to see how they affect performance per TCO.</li>

      <li><strong>Preset Profiles:</strong> Add top 10 clusters from the Top500 or Green500 list and improve currently available Alex (A40, A100) and Helma (H100) profiles.</li>

  	  <li><strong>Sourcing prices other than deltacomputer:</strong> Sourcing prices from deltacomputer.com when available; otherwise from alternate.de, sysgen.de, or internal records. VAT will be added if missing. One can always adjust the pricing (or take best option) if needed.</li>
      <li> Allow modeling of how GPU prices, electricity rates, grid carbon intensity might change over 5–10 years (e.g. falling GPU cost, rising carbon tax). Run forecasts / scenarios (optimistic, pessimistic).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
    <li><strong>Low-impact features (fun add-ons):</strong>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Configuration Recommendation Engine:</strong> Suggest actionable ways to improve performance/TCO based on current inputs (trained on user sessions or simulated configs). If a user sets a constraint (power < X, emissions < Y), highlight or warn when configurations exceed constraints. Currently only provides a basic rule-based Smart Strategy Tip.</li>

  <li><strong>Detailed PDF Report Generator:</strong> Export project reports with charts and explanations and add a report format toggle (Summary vs. Detailed). Currently offers only a simple PDF report generator.</li>
    
  <li><strong>Collaboration Mode:</strong> Share calculation setups with teammates via unique, bookmarkable, shareable public URLs with embedded settings. Currently includes a simple auto-generated blog summary share option. Let users log in, store their configurations, revisit, manage scenario libraries.
Let users save, name, version multiple scenarios, compare over time; share with collaborators; comment, version diffing.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Programmatic Access:</strong> Expose Wattlytics as an API for researchers and developers so other tools (cluster schedulers, infrastructure planners) can query TCO estimations programmatically. Currently limited to a private GitHub repository.</li>
      
  <li><strong>Currency Selector:</strong> Support for USD, GBP, INR, and more. Currently only supports EUR.</li>

  <li><strong>SEO Optimization:</strong> Add meta tags, sitemap.xml, alt text.</li>
</ul>
</ul>



        <h2> Model Assessment of Current Extensions; 🚦Overengineered?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong> ✅ Frequency Factor</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> W_node_baseline(f_cCPU, f_ucCPU) = W_baseCPU + W_dynamicCPU + W_noncompute</li>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> W_gpu(f_GPU)</li>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> f_cCPU, f_ucCPU and f_GPU represents core CPU frequency, uncore CPU frequency and GPU frequency. Example: On Alex, power usage is split as 11.6% CPU, 55% GPU, and 33.4% non-compute (including 6% fan and 27.4% other components) </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>❓ Cooling Types & PUE Modeling</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> PUE = (factor_air * PUE_Air + factor_water * PUE_Water) / 2</li>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> Incorporates cooling types (air-cooled, water-cooled), weighting factors for the fraction of energy consumption between air-cooled and water-cooled cluster to model heterogeneous clusters. Another variation: different codes on CPU and GPU clusters with varying PUEs require a weighted sum of benchmark power use.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>❓ Maintenance Cost Split: Capital vs. Operational</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> Capital cost applies to the first 3 years (as per DFG rules), while operational cost covers the remaining lifetime.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>❓ Hardware vs. Software Maintenance Split</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>❓ Software Cost Dependency on Node Count</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> Many commercial licenses scale with node count, such as Moya scheduler, SUSE Enterprise, or IBM file systems like GPFS.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>❓ Data Center Temperature as a Factor</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> Temperature is a side effect of cooling infrastructure; efforts to reduce it (e.g., via chilled air or cooling systems) must be factored into the TCO.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>❓ CO2 Emission Factor</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> One can show “performance per kg CO₂”, or visualize "emissions over lifetime," or assumes 100% green electricity usage at FAU.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>❓ Net Present Value (NPV) Factor</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> NPV compares the value of future cash flows to the initial investment. Clearly define cash flow periods in the model.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  <li>
        <strong>❓Expand the model beyond “heat reuse revenue” and “factor”</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> district heating, thermal credit, carbon offsets.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  <li>
        <strong>❓Risk, failure rates, replacement costs</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> E.g., after X years some fraction of hardware fails, or maintenance increases.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>⚠️ Conflict: Billed per hour vs. per kWh</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comment:</strong> A high-efficiency application may consume more power but finish faster—lowering runtime costs while increasing energy bills. Flag in documentation or include as a toggle option.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
