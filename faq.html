            <h2>General Questions</h2>

            <h3>What is Wattlytics?</h3>
            <p>
                It’s a cost-efficiency metric calculated as:  
                <strong>GPU performance ÷ Total Cost of Ownership over the system lifetime</strong>.  
                It helps identify which GPUs deliver the most performance per euro spent.
            </p>

            <h3>Who should use this tool?</h3>
            <p>
                It’s useful for researchers, HPC administrators, grant planners, and procurement teams evaluating GPU nodes based on real budget constraints and workload needs.
            </p>

            <h2>Technical Documentation</h2>

            <h3>Do I need to fill out every slider?</h3>
            <p>
                No. Default values are provided based on typical HPC cluster assumptions. You can modify only the parameters relevant to your scenario.
            </p>

            <h3>What does “Same number of GPUs for all types” mean?</h3>
            <p>
                When enabled, each GPU type is compared using the same number of GPUs per node. When disabled, the configuration scales GPUs to fit the budget.
            </p>

            <h3>How are benchmark IDs used?</h3>
            <p>
                Each ID corresponds to a measured or modeled performance and power for GROMACS or AMBER workloads. Select the one closest to your target use case.
            </p>

            <h3>Can I export the results?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes. You can export both the performance/TCO results and sensitivity analysis as CSV files and charts for further analysis or reporting.
            </p>

            <h2>Tip Features & Blog Generator</h2>

            <h3>How does the Tip Assistant work?</h3>
            <p>
                As you adjust inputs, the assistant provides smart suggestions based on current values and cost-impact heuristics.
            </p>

            <h3>What is the auto blog generator?</h3>
            <p>
                After running a calculation, you can generate a Markdown-style summary of the analysis — ideal for documentation, proposals, or sharing insights.
            </p>

            <h2>Privacy & Data</h2>

            <h3>Is any data saved or tracked?</h3>
            <p>
                No user input is stored or sent anywhere. All calculations are performed locally in your browser.
            </p>

            <h3>Is the tool open source?</h3>
            <p>
                Only partially — but it may be released under a permissive license in the future. Stay tuned!
